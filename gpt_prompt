Create a web application that will allow someone to track their tasks using an Agile/Scrum approach similar to Trello by Atlassian. Tasks will be added to cards, and columns will be used to determine the workflow and current status of each task.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: Express.js
- Frontend: Vue.js
- Database: MySQL

Requirements:
1. **Virtual Environment:**
   - Implement a virtual environment similar to Python's venv for this project. Is it possible with this approach?

2. **Containerization:**
   - Establish the web application in a Kubernetes Helm containerization environment.

3. **Development Environment:**
   - Development will be done using VS Code and the Terminal will utilize WSL (Ubuntu).

4. **Infrastructure Automation:**
   - Utilize scripts such as Ansible or Terraform to automate the infrastructure setup, making the process reusable.

Backend:
- The backend structure should be modular and well-organized to ensure easy management and scalability. This modularity should also facilitate easier troubleshooting.

Frontend:
- The visuals need to be clean, with rounded edges where possible, drop shadows, and good contrast for visually challenged users.
- Customization options for windows, backgrounds, etc., from a settings menu.
- The general view should be simple, showing minimal content unless a button is clicked to open a panel for settings, preferences, adjustments, action items, etc.
- User data will be stored in customizable cards that hold task-related information.

Authentication and User Management:
- Implement user authentication and management with role-based access control.

Roles and Permissions:
- **System Administrator**: Has full access to all features and settings within the web application, without any restrictions.
  
- **Project Roles**:
  - **Project Owner**: Has full control over the project, including deletion and renaming, and all permissions of roles below.
  - **Project Lead**: Has access to all project features and settings except deletion and renaming of the project, and all permissions of roles below.
  - **Member**: Can add, edit, and remove their own cards within the project and view all cards, but cannot access project settings or manage others' cards.
  - **Guest**: Can only view cards within the project; no permissions to add, edit, remove cards, or access project settings.

Role Assignment:
- System Administrators can assign/edit members of any roles.
- Project Owners can assign a co-owner and assign/edit members of any lower roles.
- Project Leads can assign another Project Lead and assign/edit members of any lower roles.

Containerization:
- The entire application will need to use Kubernetes Helm Containerization as the infrastructure.
- Provide the necessary steps, commands, and files to accomplish this.
- Ensure all templates in Helm do not contain static data; all data in the templates must be supplied by the values.yaml.
